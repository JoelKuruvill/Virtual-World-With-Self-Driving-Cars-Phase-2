A project I created following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/). Learning to create a Virtual Environment using the JS Canvas.

This is phase 2 of the Self Driving Car Course I completed earlier; learning about neural networks and working with the JS Canvas.
