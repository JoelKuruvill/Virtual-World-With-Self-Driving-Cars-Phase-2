# Virtual World With Self Driving Cars Phase 2
Created: 2024-May-15 | Updated: 2024-June-30

A project I created following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/).

This is phase 2 of the Self Driving Car Course I completed earlier, learning about neural networks and working with the JS Canvas.


I started with setting up this project but then decided to complete part 1 first.
Part 1: https://self-driving-car-with-javascript.onrender.com
