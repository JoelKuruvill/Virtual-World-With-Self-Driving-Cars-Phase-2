# Virtual World With Self Driving Cars Phase 2
**Started:** 2024-May-15 \
**Updated:** 2025-June-9

A project I created following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/). Learning to create a Virtual Environment using the JS Canvas.

This is phase 2 of the Self Driving Car Course I completed earlier; learning about neural networks and working with the JS Canvas.

**Phase 2 Deployment:** Soon(tm).\
**Phase 2 Repository:** https://github.com/JoelKuruvill/Virtual-World-With-Self-Driving-Cars-Phase-2

I started with setting up this project but then decided to complete part 1 first. \
**Part 1 Deployment:** https://self-driving-car-with-javascript.onrender.com \
**Part 1 Repository:** https://github.com/JoelKuruvill/self-driving-car-with-javascript

Stopped at 2hr03mins18secs.

# Learning Notes
