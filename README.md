# Virtual World With Self Driving Cars Phase 2
Created: 2024-May-15 | Updated: 2025-June-5

A project I created following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/).

This is phase 2 of the Self Driving Car Course I completed earlier, learning about neural networks and working with the JS Canvas.

Make your design.. "not just good, but really good"

I started with setting up this project but then decided to complete part 1 first.
